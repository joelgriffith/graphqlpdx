## Composing & Organizng GraphQL Schemas
@joefraley  
There are lots of way to break your Schemas apart into easy-to-understand modules. There are currently [open discussions](https://github.com/apollostack/graphql-tools/issues/186#issuecomment-267834695) in the GraphQL community about best practices, this talk would touch on a few. For example:

1. Native language splatting.
2. The GraphQL spec `extend type` operator.
3. Packages like `graphql-merge`
