# GraphQLPDX

Repository for the Portland-based GraphQL meetup group. This repo will be home for various things related to the group, including talk proposals, demo code/applications, assets for events and whatnot. Have an issues/talk? Submit a PR or file an issue!

## Submit a Talk!

It's as easy as making a PR! Just make sure you have:

- A _new_ entry into the `talks` directory. With the date of your talk.
- The File _must_ be in the format of : `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- In the case there's multiple talks, simply add your talks details on the md file of the date you wish to speak!

## Demo code

If your talk comes with a fancy demo, you can also add it to this repo if you'd like (not required). I've done so for the first meetup, and kept it small so things aren't super noisy here.
